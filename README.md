## Background:
# Easy to use and secure redaction tool “RE-DACT” which allows redaction/masking/anonymization on various input formats based on a gradational scale defined by the user and providing customized output. 👇🏼
# Over a time, model will learn and have the ability to generate realistic synthetic data in any sought format. 

## Description: ##
# The proposed solution is a natural language processing (machine learning) based redaction tool.👇🏼
# The tool will redact or obfuscate from original data leaving the output structurally/logically the same but stripped of key identifiers and 👇🏼
# other content which may in any way allow the identity, actual data, markers or issues in the input content to be revealed. 👇🏼
# The correlational logic may be appropriately obfuscated based on the degree of redaction. 👇🏼
# This will have an easy to use GUI and will be available for use on online and offline systems. 👇🏼
# The degree of the redaction will be up to the user- the higher the degree set by the user, the more the degree of redaction. 👇🏼
# This will work with all different commonly used formats for text and data sets. 👇🏼
# Security of data will be assured by ensuring that the input data is not stored or retrievable in any fashion by third party entities.👇🏼
# User will have complete control over the input data. 👇🏼
# It is also an important aspect that sometimes data may be required to be stored or submitted, however specific sensitive details may not necessarily be required. 👇🏼
# In such a situation- anonymized data authenticated as having being redacted from original would suffice. 👇🏼
# Declassification processes are long and arduous; anonymization is largely manual or custom script driven.👇🏼
# By providing a gradational redaction option, ordinary users can strip away the specificity to the extent of liking-from merely name removal/anonymization to completely synthetic data with only faint traces of original structure/pattern. 👇🏼
# This can allow generation of large number of databases with realistic but anonymized data that can be shared for learning, growth and commercial ventures.👇🏼
# Expected Solution: Problem Statement: Easy to use and secure redaction tool “RE-DACT” which allows redaction/masking/anonymization on various input formats based on a gradational scale defined by the user and providing customized output.👇🏼
# Over a time, model will learn and have the ability to generate realistic synthetic data in any sought format. 

# Stage 1 Data: Curate and use own data set for building PoC Task/Result: Input/Output: Supports common input formats (text files, images) and basic output formats (redacted files, logs). 👇🏼
# Web based version Training Dataset: Publicly available dataset can be used for the purpose. Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score on Open Source Testing dataset.

# Stage 2 Data: Dataset will be provided in Grand Finale Task/Result: Input/Output: Expands to handle more data formats (e.g., PDFs, videos) and advanced output options (e.g., redacted versions with annotations). 👇🏼
# Training Dataset: Diverse data set prepared from commonly used formats Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score on Open Source Testing dataset. Performance/Evaluation Criteria: • PoC will be preferred over just concept or presentation.👇🏼
# The performance may be ascertained on the following metrics: • Efficacy of the redaction/anonymization- whether appropriate data has been redacted • Gradational effect achieved based on user preference and ability to calibrate. • Ability to work on a variety of input sources • Security of the input data by minimal retention • Speed • Optimized computing usage and ability to operate at scale. • Ease of use, UI, UX. • Performance benchmarked against COTS solutions. • Web Based and Offline solution. • Minimal API dependency • Use of Secure Coding Practices and cybersecurity built in design....
